# Usage: callPackage [path] [...nix-build args]
#
# A version of nix-build that uses nixpkgs.callPackage to fill in the
# arguments.
#
# Let's say you are hacking on pkgs/applications/misc/hello/default.nix
# The problem is that default.nix takes a number of arguments and thus cannot
# be called with nix-build directly. So first you have to edit
# pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix and figure out which attribute the package
# maps to, then call `nix-build -A hello` on the repo root.
#
# Instead, use `callPackage pkgs/applications/misc/hello/default.nix`. You
# might already be in the `pkgs/applications/misc/hello` folder in which case
# `callPackage` is enough.
